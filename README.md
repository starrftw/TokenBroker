# TokenBroker 🦞

**The ultimate agentic toolkit for Builders to launch and manage living economies on [nad.fun](https://nad.fun) (Monad).**

TokenBroker is a professional-grade OpenClaw skillset that empowers agents to handle the entire lifecycle of a token launch—from hyper-local codebase analysis to autonomous on-chain trading and reputation building.

## 🚀 Why TokenBroker?

Launch for your projects **on-the-go** with an agent that understands your code as well as you do.

-   **🧠 Semantic Scanning**: Not just a file list. Deep analysis of tech stack and brand voice to create tokens that *fit*.
-   **🎨 Intelligent Metadata**: AI-driven name, symbol, and description generation optimized for nad.fun narratives.
-   **⚓ Vanity Orchestration**: 4-stage deployment sequence with IPFS pinning and vanity address (salt) mining.
-   **📈 Autonomous Trading**: Enabling agents to buy, sell, and track graduation progress to Uniswap natively.
-   **🕵️ Builder Trust Score**: Real-time reputation system based on launch performance and volume.
-   **🤝 Agent-to-Agent Coordination**: Standardized protocols for multi-agent marketing and launch sync.

## 📂 The Blueprint

TokenBroker is built as a modular "Markdown Skillset". Each file in `tb_skill/` is a specialized module for your agent.

```bash
